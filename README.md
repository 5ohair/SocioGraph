# SocioGraph

## About The Project
Sociograph, developed in C++ with Raylib for the GUI, offers an interactive platform to sign 
up, log in, follow users, search profiles, and explore connections. It efficiently manages user 
data and relationships using core DSA concepts like graphs, BFS, file handling, and 
mappings, demonstrating a practical implementation of basic social network 
functionalities
## Opening the Project
To open the project, simply place the SocioGraph folder on your computer and open it through Visual Studio Code. Once the folder is loaded, all source files, assets, and configurations become available for editing. Visual Studio Code automatically recognizes the project structure and prepares the environment for development.

## Preparing the Environment
SocioGraph relies on Raylib for all visual output. Make sure Raylib is installed and properly linked to the development environment so that the project can access its graphical features. The project also requires a C or C++ compiler that is compatible with Raylib and Visual Studio Code. Once Raylib is set up, Visual Studio Code can handle the editing, building, and running of the project.

## Running the Project
The project is run directly through Visual Studio Code. After the environment is prepared and Raylib is linked, the application can be launched from within the IDE. When it runs, Raylib opens a graphical window where the user interface and all rendered elements of SocioGraph appear. The program continues to update visually as it runs, using Raylib’s rendering loop.

## Additional Information
SocioGraph may use additional files such as images, fonts, or data resources. These should remain in the project’s designated folders so the application can access them during runtime. The performance of the program depends on Raylib’s rendering capabilities, so it should be run on a system that supports its graphical requirements.
